# Pull requests
To contribute, clone the repository, make your changes, commit and push to your clone, and submit a pull request.

Before making changes, if you think that your feature will result in more than 100 lines changing, find me and talk to me about the feature you are proposing. It pains me to reject the hard work someone else did, but I won't add everything to the repo, and it's better if the rejection happens before you have to waste time working on the feature.

If you are making changes to used libraries or the installation script, you must verify them to work on default Windows installation from scratch. If you cannot test if it works (due to your OS or anything else), do not make those changes (with possible exception of changes that explicitly are guarded from being executed on Windows by `if`s or something else).


# Code style
I mostly follow code style suggested by PyCharm, with the exception of disabled line length limit. Please do not submit PRs where you just take existing lines and reformat them without changing what they do.

# Gradio
Gradio at some point wanted to add this section to shill their project in the contributing section, which I didn't have at the time, so here it is now.

For [Gradio](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio) check out the [docs](https://gradio.app/docs/) to contribute:
Have an issue or feature request with Gradio? open a issue/feature request on github for support: https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/issues
