To contribute, clone the repository, make your changes, commit and push to your clone, and submit a pull request.

Before making changes, if you think that your feature will result in more than 100 lines changing, find me and talk to me about the feature you are proposing. It pains me to reject the hard work someone else did, but I won't add everything to the repo, and it's better if the rejection happens before you have to waste time working on the feature.
