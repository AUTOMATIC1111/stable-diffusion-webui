> AUTOMATIC1111's webUI + Krita Plugin

![demo image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42513874/194701722-e7a3f7eb-be4a-4f43-93a5-480835c9260f.jpg)

Why use this?

- Optimized focus inpainting workflow allowing multiple models to be used for advanced composition of multiple characters.
- AUTOMATIC1111's webUI works alongside plugin to allow using features not available yet in the plugin's UI without restarting.
- Updated regularly with upstream AUTOMATIC1111's features & fixes.

This repository was originally a fork of [sddebz/stable-diffusion-krita-plugin](https://github.com/sddebz/stable-diffusion-krita-plugin), which is itself a fork of [AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui), the most featureful & performant SD fork yet. The main value adds are fixing the commit history, thoroughly refactoring the plugin code for future development, and maintenance.

## FAQ

Q: How hard is it to install?

A: It is basically AUTOMATIC1111 + a few extra steps. aka almost one-click install.

<hr/>

Q: How hard is it to run?

A: The launch process is exactly the same as AUTOMATIC1111, to the point the Gradio webUI functions normally.

<hr/>

Q: How does the base_size, max_size system work?

A:

It is an alternative to AUTO's highres fix that works for all modes, not just txt2img.

The selection will be resized such that the shorter dimension is base_size. However, if the aforementioned resize causes the longer dimension to exceed max_size, the shorter dimension will be resized to less than base_size. Setting base_size and max_size higher can be used to generate higher resolution images (along with their issues), essentially **disabling the system**, _though it might make sense for img2img mode_.

This is actually smarter than the builtin highres fix + firstphase width/height system. Thank the original plugin writer, @sddebz, for writing this.

<hr/>

Q: Outpainting?

A: No outpainting MK2 yet, but nothing stopping you from doing basic outpainting. 1) expand canvas 2) scribble in blank area 3) img2img on blank area + some of image.

<hr/>

Q: Is the model loaded into memory twice?

A: No, it shares the same backend. Both the Krita plugin and webUI can be used concurrently.

<hr/>

Q: How can you commit to updating regularly?

A: The plugin builds on top the internal API without modifying it, and good documentation practices facilitate adapting to upstream changes and bugfixing.

<hr/>

Q: Will it work with other Krita plugin backends?

A: Unfortunately no, all plugins so far have different APIs. The official API is coming soon though...
