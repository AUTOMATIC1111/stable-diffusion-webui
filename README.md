# Stable Diffusion web UI
A browser interface based on Gradio library for Stable Diffusion.

Check the [custom scripts](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/Custom-Scripts) wiki page for extra scripts developed by users.

## Features
[Detailed feature showcase with images](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/Features):
- Original txt2img and img2img modes
- One click install and run script (but you still must install python and git)
- Outpainting
- Inpainting
- Prompt Matrix
- Stable Diffusion Upscale
- Attention, specify parts of text that the model should pay more attention to
    - a man in a ((tuxedo)) - will pay more attention to tuxedo
    - a man in a (tuxedo:1.21) - alternative syntax
- Loopback, run img2img processing multiple times
- X/Y plot, a way to draw a 2 dimensional plot of images with different parameters
- Textual Inversion
    - have as many embeddings as you want and use any names you like for them
    - use multiple embeddings with different numbers of vectors per token
    - works with half precision floating point numbers
- Extras tab with:
    - GFPGAN, neural network that fixes faces
    - CodeFormer, face restoration tool as an alternative to GFPGAN
    - RealESRGAN, neural network upscaler
    - ESRGAN, neural network upscaler with a lot of third party models
    - SwinIR, neural network upscaler
    - LDSR, Latent diffusion super resolution upscaling
- Resizing aspect ratio options
- Sampling method selection
- Interrupt processing at any time
- 4GB video card support (also reports of 2GB working)
- Correct seeds for batches 
- Prompt length validation
     - get length of prompt in tokens as you type
     - get a warning after generation if some text was truncated
- Generation parameters
     - parameters you used to generate images are saved with that image
     - in PNG chunks for PNG, in EXIF for JPEG
     - can drag the image to PNG info tab to restore generation parameters and automatically copy them into UI
     - can be disabled in settings
- Settings page
- Running arbitrary python code from UI (must run with --allow-code to enable)
- Mouseover hints for most UI elements
- Possible to change defaults/mix/max/step values for UI elements via text config
- Random artist button
- Tiling support, a checkbox to create images that can be tiled like textures
- Progress bar and live image generation preview
- Negative prompt, an extra text field that allows you to list what you don't want to see in generated image
- Styles, a way to save part of prompt and easily apply them via dropdown later
- Variations, a way to generate same image but with tiny differences
- Seed resizing, a way to generate same image but at slightly different resolution
- CLIP interrogator, a button that tries to guess prompt from an image
- Prompt Editing, a way to change prompt mid-generation, say to start making a watermelon and switch to anime girl midway
- Batch Processing, process a group of files using img2img
- Img2img Alternative
- Highres Fix, a convenience option to produce high resolution pictures in one click without usual distortions
- Reloading checkpoints on the fly
- Checkpoint Merger, a tab that allows you to merge two checkpoints into one
- [Custom scripts](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/Custom-Scripts) with many extensions from community

## Installation and Running
Make sure the required [dependencies](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/Dependencies) are met and follow the instructions available for both [NVidia](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/Install-and-Run-on-NVidia-GPUs) (recommended) and [AMD](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/Install-and-Run-on-AMD-GPUs) GPUs.

Alternatively, use Google Colab:

- [Colab, maintained by Akaibu](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1kw3egmSn-KgWsikYvOMjJkVDsPLjEMzl)
- [Colab, original by me, outdated](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Iy-xW9t1-OQWhb0hNxueGij8phCyluOh).

### Automatic Installation on Windows
1. Install [Python 3.10.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/), checking "Add Python to PATH"
2. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
3. Download the stable-diffusion-webui repository, for example by running `git clone https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui.git`.
4. Place `model.ckpt` in the `models` directory (see [dependencies](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/Dependencies) for where to get it).
5. _*(Optional)*_ Place `GFPGANv1.4.pth` in the base directory, alongside `webui.py` (see [dependencies](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/Dependencies) for where to get it).
6. Run `webui-user.bat` from Windows Explorer as normal, non-administrator, user.

### Automatic Installation on Linux
1. Install the dependencies:
```bash
# Debian-based:
sudo apt install wget git python3 python3-venv
# Red Hat-based:
sudo dnf install wget git python3
# Arch-based:
sudo pacman -S wget git python3
```
2. To install in `/home/$(whoami)/stable-diffusion-webui/`, run:
```bash
bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/master/webui.sh)
