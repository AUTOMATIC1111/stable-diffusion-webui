## Installing and running

You need [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) and [git](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
installed to run this, and an NVidia videocard.

I tested the installation to work Windows with Python 3.8.10, and with Python 3.10.6. You may be able
to have success with different versions.

You need `model.ckpt`, Stable Diffusion model checkpoint, a big file containing the neural network weights. You
can obtain it from the following places:
 - [official download](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v-1-4-original)
 - [file storage](https://drive.yerf.org/wl/?id=EBfTrmcCCUAGaQBXVIj5lJmEhjoP1tgl)
 - magnet:?xt=urn:btih:3a4a612d75ed088ea542acac52f9f45987488d1c&dn=sd-v1-4.ckpt&tr=udp%3a%2f%2ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3a6969%2fannounce&tr=udp%3a%2f%2ftracker.opentrackr.org%3a1337

You optionally can use GPFGAN to improve faces, then you'll need to download the model from [here](https://github.com/TencentARC/GFPGAN/releases/download/v1.3.0/GFPGANv1.3.pth).

To use ESRGAN models, put them into ESRGAN directory in the same location as webui.py. A file will be loaded
as model if it has .pth extension. Grab models from the [Model Database](https://upscale.wiki/wiki/Model_Database).

### Automatic installation/launch

- install [Python 3.10.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) and check "Add Python to PATH" during installation. You must install this exact version.
- install [git](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- install [CUDA 11.3](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11.3.0-download-archive?target_os=Windows&target_arch=x86_64)
- place `model.ckpt` into webui directory, next to `webui.bat`.
- _*(optional)*_ place `GFPGANv1.3.pth` into webui directory, next to `webui.bat`.
- run `webui.bat` from Windows Explorer.

#### Troublehooting:

- According to reports, intallation currently does not work in a directory with spaces in filenames.
- if your version of Python is not in PATH (or if another version is), edit `webui.bat`, change the line `set PYTHON=python` to say the full path to your python executable: `set PYTHON=B:\soft\Python310\python.exe`. You can do this for python, but not for git.
- if you get out of memory errors and your videocard has low amount of VRAM (4GB), edit `webui.bat`, change line 5 to from `set COMMANDLINE_ARGS=` to `set COMMANDLINE_ARGS=--medvram` (see below for other possible options)
- installer creates python virtual environment, so none of installed modules will affect your system installation of python if you had one prior to installing this.
- to prevent the creation of virtual environment and use your system python, edit `webui.bat` replacing `set VENV_DIR=venv` with `set VENV_DIR=`.
- webui.bat installs requirements from files `requirements_versions.txt`, which lists versions for modules specifically compatible with Python 3.10.6. If you choose to install for a different version of python, editing `webui.bat` to have `set REQS_FILE=requirements.txt` instead of `set REQS_FILE=requirements_versions.txt` may help (but I still reccomend you to just use the recommended version of python).
- if you feel you broke something and want to reinstall from scratch, delete directories: `venv`, `repositories`.

## Google collab

If you don't want or can't run locally, here is google collab that allows you to run the webui:

https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Iy-xW9t1-OQWhb0hNxueGij8phCyluOh

### Manual instructions
Alternatively, if you don't want to run webui.bat, here are instructions for installing
everything by hand:

```commandline
:: crate a directory somewhere for stable diffusion and open cmd in it;
:: make sure you are in the right directory; the command must output the directory you chose
echo %cd%

:: install torch with CUDA support. See https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ for more instructions if this fails.
pip install torch --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113

:: check if torch supports GPU; this must output "True". You need CUDA 11. installed for this. You might be able to use
:: a different version, but this is what I tested.
python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"

:: clone Stable Diffusion repositories
git clone https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion.git
git clone https://github.com/CompVis/taming-transformers

:: install requirements of Stable Diffusion
pip install transformers==4.19.2 diffusers invisible-watermark

:: install k-diffusion
pip install git+https://github.com/crowsonkb/k-diffusion.git

:: (optional) install GFPGAN to fix faces
pip install git+https://github.com/TencentARC/GFPGAN.git

:: go into stable diffusion's repo directory
cd stable-diffusion

:: clone web ui
git clone https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui.git

:: install requirements of web ui
pip install -r stable-diffusion-webui/requirements.txt

:: update numpy to latest version
pip install -U numpy

:: (outside of command line) put stable diffusion model into models/ldm/stable-diffusion-v1/model.ckpt; you'll have
:: to create one missing directory;
:: the command below must output something like: 1 File(s) 4,265,380,512 bytes
dir models\ldm\stable-diffusion-v1\model.ckpt

:: (outside of command line) put the GFPGAN model into same directory as webui script
:: the command below must output something like: 1 File(s) 348,632,874 bytes
dir stable-diffusion-webui\GFPGANv1.3.pth
```

After that the installation is finished.

Run the command to start web ui:

```
python stable-diffusion-webui/webui.py
```

If you have a 4GB video card, run the command with either `--lowvram` or `--medvram` argument:

```
python stable-diffusion-webui/webui.py --medvram
```

After a while, you will get a message like this:

```
Running on local URL:  http://127.0.0.1:7860/
```

Open the URL in browser, and you are good to go.


### What options to use for low VRAM videocards?
- If you have 4GB VRAM and want to make 512x512 (or maybe up to 640x640) images, use `--medvram`.
- If you have 4GB VRAM and want to make 512x512 images, but you get an out of memory error with `--medvram`, use `--medvram --opt-split-attention` instead.
- If you have 4GB VRAM and want to make 512x512 images, and you still get an out of memory error, use `--lowvram --always-batch-cond-uncond --opt-split-attention` instead.
- If you have 4GB VRAM and want to make images larger than you can with `--medvram`, use  `--lowvram --opt-split-attention`.
- If you have more VRAM and want to make larger images than you can usually make, use `--medvram --opt-split-attention`. You can use `--lowvram`
also but the effect will likely be barely noticeable.
- Otherwise, do not use any of those.

Extra: if you get a green screen instead of generated pictures, you have a card that doesn't support half
precision floating point numbers. You must use `--precision full --no-half` in addition to other flags,
and the model will take much more space in VRAM.

### How to change UI defaults?

After running once, a `ui-config.json` file appears in webui directory:

```json
{
    "txt2img/Sampling Steps/value": 20,
    "txt2img/Sampling Steps/minimum": 1,
    "txt2img/Sampling Steps/maximum": 150,
    "txt2img/Sampling Steps/step": 1,
    "txt2img/Batch count/value": 1,
    "txt2img/Batch count/minimum": 1,
    "txt2img/Batch count/maximum": 32,
    "txt2img/Batch count/step": 1,
    "txt2img/Batch size/value": 1,
    "txt2img/Batch size/minimum": 1,
```

Edit values to your liking and the next time you launch the program they will be applied.
