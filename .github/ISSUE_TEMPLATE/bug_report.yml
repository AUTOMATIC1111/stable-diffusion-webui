        Please perform basic debugging to see if extensions or configuration is the cause of the issue.
        Basic debug procedure
        　1. Disable all third-party extensions - check if extension is the cause
        　2. Update extensions and webui - sometimes things just need to be updated
        　3. Backup and remove your config.json and ui-config.json - check if the issue is caused by bad configuration
        　4. Delete venv with third-party extensions disabled - sometimes extensions might cause wrong libraries to be installed
        　5. Try a fresh installation webui in a different directory - see if a clean installation solves the issue
        Before making a issue report please, check that the issue hasn't been reported recently.
      options:
        - label: The issue exists after disabling all extensions
        - label: The issue exists on a clean installation of webui
        - label: The issue is caused by an extension, but I believe it is caused by a bug in the webui
        - label: The issue exists in the current version of the webui
        - label: The issue has not been reported before recently
        - label: The issue has been reported before but has not been fixed yet

      description: System info file, generated by WebUI. You can generate it in settings, on the Sysinfo page. Drag the file into the field to upload it. If you submit your report without including the sysinfo file, the report will be closed. If needed, review the report to make sure it includes no personal information you don't want to share. If you can't start WebUI, you can use --dump-sysinfo commandline argument to generate the file.

        1. Go to WebUI Settings -> Sysinfo -> Download system info.
            If WebUI fails to launch, use --dump-sysinfo commandline argument to generate the file
        2. Upload the Sysinfo as a attached file, Do NOT paste it in as plain text.
