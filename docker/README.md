# Docker and compose support for Stable Diffusion web UI

This folder contains files necessary to build and run Stable Diffusion web UI as a docker container.
<br/>
As for now, only the Nvidia acceleration on Linux is supported.<br/>
This docker image is intended mainly for people already familiar with docker and looking for 
additional security provided by container isolation, for example when running untrusted scripts or
models. Additional functionality as integration with 
[docker-gen](https://github.com/nginx-proxy/docker-gen) and 
[acme-companion](https://github.com/nginx-proxy/acme-companion) for automatic access via SSL might 
come in handy too.


## Requirements
* A [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) of course.
* [Nvidia docker runtime](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html#docker).


# HOWTO

1. Make sure you have [Nvidia docker runtime](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html#docker)
installed and configured properly, i.e.
`docker run --rm --runtime=nvidia --gpus all nvidia/cuda:11.6.2-base-ubuntu20.04 nvidia-smi`
outputs the information about your GPU.
1. Enter this very directory `stable-diffusion-webui/docker`.
1. Build the container using `./build.sh` or `docker compose build`.
1. Run the container with `./run.sh`
1. Wait for the UI to start then open the URL displayed on the screen:
```
 ./run.sh

Wait for the UI to start then point your browser to: http://localhost:xxxxx   <-----

# Further info

1. This image uses two volumes. One is used to store `~/.cache`, the other for 
`stable-diffusion-webui/modules`. The latter is mounted in the `docker-compose.yml` to a 
corresponding location inside the local path on your host. This is intended to make it easier
for the user to manipulate model files.
1. Beware though that inside container the UI is run as root. This has the implication that files
written to volumes mounted to local path are owned by root! When needed you may change the 
ownership of existing files with `sudo chown -R $UID:$GID modules`.
1. To change the command line arguments or other configuration copy the `docker-compose.yml` file
as `docker-compose.override.yml` and make necessary changes there. It's the `compose` mechanism and
this way it won't conflict with the git. The part you are looking for is at the very end of the
YAML file: `command: python3 launch.py --listen`
