    """
    This structure stores a list of rotated boxes as a Nx5 torch.Tensor.
    It supports some common methods about boxes

    """

    def __init__(self, tensor: torch.Tensor):
        """
        Args:
            tensor (Tensor[float]): a Nx5 matrix.  Each row is
                (x_center, y_center, width, height, angle),
                in which angle is represented in degrees.
                While there's no strict range restriction for it,
                the recommended principal range is between [-180, 180) degrees.

        Assume we have a horizontal box B = (x_center, y_center, width, height),
        where width is along the x-axis and height is along the y-axis.
        The rotated box B_rot (x_center, y_center, width, height, angle)
        can be seen as:

        1. When angle == 0:
           B_rot == B
        2. When angle > 0:
           B_rot is obtained by rotating B w.r.t its center by :math:`|angle|` degrees CCW;
        3. When angle < 0:
           B_rot is obtained by rotating B w.r.t its center by :math:`|angle|` degrees CW.

        Mathematically, since the right-handed coordinate system for image space
        is (y, x), where y is top->down and x is left->right, the 4 vertices of the
        rotated rectangle :math:`(yr_i, xr_i)` (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) can be obtained from
        the vertices of the horizontal rectangle :math:`(y_i, x_i)` (i = 1, 2, 3, 4)
        in the following way (:math:`\\theta = angle*\\pi/180` is the angle in radians,
        :math:`(y_c, x_c)` is the center of the rectangle):

        .. math::

            yr_i = \\cos(\\theta) (y_i - y_c) - \\sin(\\theta) (x_i - x_c) + y_c,

            xr_i = \\sin(\\theta) (y_i - y_c) + \\cos(\\theta) (x_i - x_c) + x_c,

        which is the standard rigid-body rotation transformation.

        Intuitively, the angle is
        (1) the rotation angle from y-axis in image space
        to the height vector (top->down in the box's local coordinate system)
        of the box in CCW, and
        (2) the rotation angle from x-axis in image space
        to the width vector (left->right in the box's local coordinate system)
        of the box in CCW.

        More intuitively, consider the following horizontal box ABCD represented
        in (x1, y1, x2, y2): (3, 2, 7, 4),
        covering the [3, 7] x [2, 4] region of the continuous coordinate system
        which looks like this:

        .. code:: none

            O--------> x
            |
            |  A---B
            |  |   |
            |  D---C
            |
            v y

        Note that each capital letter represents one 0-dimensional geometric point
        instead of a 'square pixel' here.

        In the example above, using (x, y) to represent a point we have:

        .. math::

            O = (0, 0), A = (3, 2), B = (7, 2), C = (7, 4), D = (3, 4)

        We name vector AB = vector DC as the width vector in box's local coordinate system, and
        vector AD = vector BC as the height vector in box's local coordinate system. Initially,
        when angle = 0 degree, they're aligned with the positive directions of x-axis and y-axis
        in the image space, respectively.

        For better illustration, we denote the center of the box as E,

        .. code:: none

            O--------> x
            |
            |  A---B
            |  | E |
            |  D---C
            |
            v y

        where the center E = ((3+7)/2, (2+4)/2) = (5, 3).

        Also,

        .. math::

            width = |AB| = |CD| = 7 - 3 = 4,
            height = |AD| = |BC| = 4 - 2 = 2.

        Therefore, the corresponding representation for the same shape in rotated box in
        (x_center, y_center, width, height, angle) format is:

        (5, 3, 4, 2, 0),

        Now, let's consider (5, 3, 4, 2, 90), which is rotated by 90 degrees
        CCW (counter-clockwise) by definition. It looks like this:

        .. code:: none

            O--------> x
            |   B-C
            |   | |
            |   |E|
            |   | |
            |   A-D
            v y

        The center E is still located at the same point (5, 3), while the vertices
        ABCD are rotated by 90 degrees CCW with regard to E:
        A = (4, 5), B = (4, 1), C = (6, 1), D = (6, 5)

        Here, 90 degrees can be seen as the CCW angle to rotate from y-axis to
        vector AD or vector BC (the top->down height vector in box's local coordinate system),
        or the CCW angle to rotate from x-axis to vector AB or vector DC (the left->right
        width vector in box's local coordinate system).

        .. math::

            width = |AB| = |CD| = 5 - 1 = 4,
            height = |AD| = |BC| = 6 - 4 = 2.

        Next, how about (5, 3, 4, 2, -90), which is rotated by 90 degrees CW (clockwise)
        by definition? It looks like this:

        .. code:: none

            O--------> x
            |   D-A
            |   | |
            |   |E|
            |   | |
            |   C-B
            v y

        The center E is still located at the same point (5, 3), while the vertices
        ABCD are rotated by 90 degrees CW with regard to E:
        A = (6, 1), B = (6, 5), C = (4, 5), D = (4, 1)

        .. math::

            width = |AB| = |CD| = 5 - 1 = 4,
            height = |AD| = |BC| = 6 - 4 = 2.

        This covers exactly the same region as (5, 3, 4, 2, 90) does, and their IoU
        will be 1. However, these two will generate different RoI Pooling results and
        should not be treated as an identical box.

        On the other hand, it's easy to see that (X, Y, W, H, A) is identical to
        (X, Y, W, H, A+360N), for any integer N. For example (5, 3, 4, 2, 270) would be
        identical to (5, 3, 4, 2, -90), because rotating the shape 270 degrees CCW is
        equivalent to rotating the same shape 90 degrees CW.

        We could rotate further to get (5, 3, 4, 2, 180), or (5, 3, 4, 2, -180):

        .. code:: none

            O--------> x
            |
            |  C---D
            |  | E |
            |  B---A
            |
            v y

        .. math::

            A = (7, 4), B = (3, 4), C = (3, 2), D = (7, 2),

            width = |AB| = |CD| = 7 - 3 = 4,
            height = |AD| = |BC| = 4 - 2 = 2.

        Finally, this is a very inaccurate (heavily quantized) illustration of
        how (5, 3, 4, 2, 60) looks like in case anyone wonders:

        .. code:: none

            O--------> x
            |     B\
            |    /  C
            |   /E /
            |  A  /
            |   `D
            v y

        It's still a rectangle with center of (5, 3), width of 4 and height of 2,
        but its angle (and thus orientation) is somewhere between
        (5, 3, 4, 2, 0) and (5, 3, 4, 2, 90).
