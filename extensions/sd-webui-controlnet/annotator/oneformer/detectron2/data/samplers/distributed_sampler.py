    """
    In training, we only care about the "infinite stream" of training data.
    So this sampler produces an infinite stream of indices and
    all workers cooperate to correctly shuffle the indices and sample different indices.

    The samplers in each worker effectively produces `indices[worker_id::num_workers]`
    where `indices` is an infinite stream of indices consisting of
    `shuffle(range(size)) + shuffle(range(size)) + ...` (if shuffle is True)
    or `range(size) + range(size) + ...` (if shuffle is False)

    Note that this sampler does not shard based on pytorch DataLoader worker id.
    A sampler passed to pytorch DataLoader is used only with map-style dataset
    and will not be executed inside workers.
    But if this sampler is used in a way that it gets execute inside a dataloader
    worker, then extra work needs to be done to shard its outputs based on worker id.
    This is required so that workers don't produce identical data.
    :class:`ToIterableDataset` implements this logic.
    This note is true for all samplers in detectron2.
