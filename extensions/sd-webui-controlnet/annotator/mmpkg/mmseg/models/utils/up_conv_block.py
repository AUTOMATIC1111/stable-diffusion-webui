class UpConvBlock(nn.Module):
    """Upsample convolution block in decoder for UNet.

    This upsample convolution block consists of one upsample module
    followed by one convolution block. The upsample module expands the
    high-level low-resolution feature map and the convolution block fuses
    the upsampled high-level low-resolution feature map and the low-level
    high-resolution feature map from encoder.

    Args:
        conv_block (nn.Sequential): Sequential of convolutional layers.
        in_channels (int): Number of input channels of the high-level
        skip_channels (int): Number of input channels of the low-level
        high-resolution feature map from encoder.
        out_channels (int): Number of output channels.
        num_convs (int): Number of convolutional layers in the conv_block.
            Default: 2.
        stride (int): Stride of convolutional layer in conv_block. Default: 1.
        dilation (int): Dilation rate of convolutional layer in conv_block.
            Default: 1.
        with_cp (bool): Use checkpoint or not. Using checkpoint will save some
            memory while slowing down the training speed. Default: False.
        conv_cfg (dict | None): Config dict for convolution layer.
            Default: None.
        norm_cfg (dict | None): Config dict for normalization layer.
            Default: dict(type='BN').
        act_cfg (dict | None): Config dict for activation layer in ConvModule.
            Default: dict(type='ReLU').
        upsample_cfg (dict): The upsample config of the upsample module in
            decoder. Default: dict(type='InterpConv'). If the size of
            high-level feature map is the same as that of skip feature map
            (low-level feature map from encoder), it does not need upsample the
            high-level feature map and the upsample_cfg is None.
        dcn (bool): Use deformable convolution in convolutional layer or not.
            Default: None.
        plugins (dict): plugins for convolutional layers. Default: None.
